			<h1>Why Umbraco?</h1>
		</header>
		<article>
			<p>
				When I first started working at GrowCreate, I wasn't sure what to expect. The only previous experience in a backend language was PHP. This language was great because it is fast, easy to use and simple to get into. Suddenly, it was up to me to get to grips with a new language which I had never even considered - C#. The reason Grow uses this language is because their CMS of choice is built on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				At first I was skepticle of Umbraco and the programming language it was built on. ASP.NET and C# are both maintained by Microsoft, and up until recently were closed source. This meant that the language lived and died with Microsoft. Not to mention there were drawbacks of using C# as it's not super popular, and is a slow language when compared to something like PHP. However, I soon found that developing with this language in Microsofts bespoke IDE called Visual Studio is
				a joy.
			</p>
			<h3>Visual Studio</h3>
			<p>
				Visual Studio has a great feature called Intellisense which gives you clues about what to write by telling you what functions are available. At first I was concerned that relying on an IDE too much would hold me back further down the road, but now I realise that being a great programmer isn't about learning the syntax, but understanding the underlying concepts of proramming. Intellisense speeds up my development speeds, and I could hardly live without it now.
			</p>
			<h3>C# and ASP.NET is extensible</h3>
			<p>
				The way which C# requires you to work (being a strongly typed language) means that you have to know what you're typing. Unlike in a language like JS, you must say what your variable represents in each method, which helps when you call that method later on.
			</p>
			<h3>But wait, why Umbraco?</h3>
			<p>
				To get back to the point at hand, because Visual Studio as C# are such great tools to work with, Umbraco too is a fun CMS to work on. You can extend it easily with minimal effort, hooking into its processes with only a couple of lines of code.
			</p>
			<p>
				And there's tons of other perks too - the backend extremely modern having been built in Angular, so it works like a single page application and runs fast because of this.
