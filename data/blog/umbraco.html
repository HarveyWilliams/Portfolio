	There's no doubt about it, Umbraco is a great CMS. But every CMS comes with advantages and disadvantages. Below I have outlined them.
</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<h4>Free and open source</h4>
<p>
	Umbraco has always been open source, and with the addition of ASP.NET being made fully open source by Microsoft, it makes Umbraco a truely open CMS.
</p>
<h4>Easy to extend</h4>
<p>
	Hooking into Umbraco to control what happens before or after a page is published is a piece of cake, usually only requiring an extra line of code.
</p>
<h4>Modern back office</h4>
<p>
	The backend for Umbraco was newly redesigned with the latest version. Everything is designed to be like a single page application, where new information is loaded in using JS rather than new page requests. This makes the backend run seamlessly when you create new content.
</p>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<h4>Steep learning curve</h4>
<p>
	Installing a CMS like Wordpress is extremely easy, simply drop the files into the right WAMP or MAMP directory, and bring in a fresh database. With Umbraco it's a whole different beast. SQL Server and IIS must both be first installed, with the version of .NET which you want to use. This isn't an obvious process, and without some proper help, I never would have managed to get started with Umbraco.
</p>
<h4>Expensive to run</h4>
<p>
	Linux servers cost hardly nothing when compared to a Windows server. The minimal amount you can expect to spend on a bare bones Linux server is £3 and above, a Windows server will cost at least £10. Not to mention, that if you want to have a particularly large database exceeding 10GB in side, then you will have to pay out a license for SQL Server. All in all, Umbraco ends up as an expensive piece of kit to run.
</p>
<h4>Small community</h4>
<p>
	In comparison to something as popular as Wordpress, Umbraco does have a small community. This isn't to say that Umbraco has a small community. It's still large, and vibrant. Because of this community, and because the software is open source, we can be sure that the CMS won't be disappearing any time soon.
