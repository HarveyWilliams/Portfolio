<p>
	Almost every website that I build for a client needs to have some kind of way to contact the outside world. It might be to report an error, or if a scheduled task occured then some one might need notifying, or maybe a user has just made an order and the order details need to be sent to the owner of the site.
</p>
<p>
	Thing is, developers get lazy when they starting making emails. The technology is stuck in the past, and it's not a fun front end experience to try and create complicated layouts using tables. All of this together makes creating emails a hack and slash job. Here's the simple way a lot of emails are made:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
public bool Send()
{
	var mailServer = new SmtpClient();
	var mail = new MailMessage();

	mail.From = new MailAddress("foo.bar@net", "Foo Bar");
	mail.To.Add("bar@foo.net");
	mail.Subject = "Thank you for signing up!";
	mail.IsBodyHtml = true;

	// Don't do this!!
	mail.Body = String.Format("&lt;h2&gt;Dear {0},&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for signing up. We value you as a customer etc etc...&lt;/p&lt;&lt;p&gt;From the team at {1}.&lt;/p&gt;",
		"Bar Foo",
		"foo.bar.net");

	try
	{
		mailServer.Send(mail);
	}
	catch (SmtpException e)
	{
		LogHelper.Error(System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().DeclaringType, "Error sending welcome email.", e);
		return false;
	}

	return true;
}
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	The above doesn't look crazy bad, but just wait until the email starts getting complicated. If you want to have real formatting, then it's going to quickly get out of hand.
</p>
<h2>
	Rendering MVC emails with Razor and CSHTML templates
</h2>
<p>
	Enough of string formatting! We have a better method now. We're used to using Razor and some sort of MVC to built our ordinary website views. Surely there is some way we can incorporate that into our email design? Well there is!
</p>
<h3>
	The West Wind Toolkit Way
</h3>
<p>
	Fortunately there is a tool out there which allows us to easily render a CSHTML template with a template of our choosing. This tool is called <a href="https://github.com/RickStrahl/WestwindToolkit" target="_blank">West Wind Toolkit</a>. It's opensource and under the MIT license, meaning we can use it in our projects.
</p>
<p>
	The particular part of the toolkit we plan on using is the <a href="https://github.com/RickStrahl/WestwindToolkit/blob/master/Westwind.Web.Mvc/Utils/ViewRenderer.cs">view renderer</a>. Since I didn't want to bloat my project with anything more than necessary, I ripped apart this piece of C# that West Wind has provided us with, and only kept the core methods in the end result:

<p>
	You can also view the latest version that I will be using in my projects <a href="https://gist.github.com/HarveyWilliams/0405edd6719c16171329" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Include this view renderer in your project, and you can use it to render Razor CSHTML views with a model.
</p>
<h3>
	Building the Model
</h3>
<p>
	Before we start using the view renderer in our project, we will need to set up a model to use with our view. Below is a very simple one that covers the two properties that our model will need:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
public class NewSignUpModel
{
	public string Recipient { get; set; }
	public string Team { get; set; }
}
	</code>
</pre>
<h3>
	Building the view
</h3>
<p>
	Our view will need to reference the model we just made using @model at the top of the template:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
@using Grow.Core.Models.Mail
@model NewSignUpModel
&lt;h2&gt;Dear @(Model.Recipient),&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for signing up. We value you as a customer etc etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the team at @(Model.Team).&lt;/p&gt;
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	The @model reference allows use to then write @(Model.Recipient) where we want the parameter to be shown. But I'm sure you're used to doing this kind of thing by now.
</p>
<h3>
	Updating the mail sending method
</h3>
<p>
	Finally, we need to update our original mail send method to use the view renderer. Pass in the path to your view as the first parameter to the ViewRenderer.RenderView method, and the model you intend the view to use as the second:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
public bool Send()
{
	var mailServer = new SmtpClient();
	var mail = new MailMessage();

	mail.From = new MailAddress("foo.bar@net", "Foo Bar");
	mail.To.Add("bar@foo.net");
	mail.Subject = "Thank you for signing up!";
	mail.IsBodyHtml = true;

	mail.Body = ViewRenderer.RenderView("~/Views/Mail/NewSignUp.cshtml", new NewSignUpModel
	{
		Recipient = "Bar Foo",
		Team = "foo.bar.net"
	});

	try
	{
		mailServer.Send(mail);
	}
	catch (SmtpException e)
	{
		LogHelper.Error(System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().DeclaringType, "Error sending welcome email.", e);
		return false;
	}

	return true;
}
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Using the above method will get an email sent off but with the view that we created as the body of the email.
</p>
