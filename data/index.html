<h2>A short introduction</h2>
<p>
	Hi. I'm a web developer based in Oxford. I prefer backend development, and I have experience with PHP, but my favourite language is C#. I can also do front end development with HTML5, CSS3 (but preferably Sass) and JS. I'm a big fan of modular programming, and doing it right the first time.
</p>
<p>
	At the moment I'm working for a great company called <a href="http://growcreate.co.uk">GrowCreate</a> located just outside of Oxford. At GrowCreate I develop for an open source CMS called <a href="/blog/why-umbraco">Umbraco</a>, which is built on top of ASP.NET.
</p>
<h3>Say that again, but without the jargon</h3>
<p>
	Basically, I can build websites. If you're interested in my skills, then give me a buzz.

	Then take a look at my <a href="portfolio">portfolio</a> which shows work I've done on my own, or with GrowCreate. If you're techy and you want to see code, then take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/HarveyWilliams">GitHub</a> profile - you can even see the source files for this website.
</p>
<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>
	I'm a bit of a nerd, and I love pretty much anything open source. I'm a major fan of the Linux operating system, and I love to tweak Firefox to look and work exactly how I like it. Whenever I'm working, and pretty much whenever there's a moment of silence, I like to listen to music. Anything with a guitar and an indie feel I'll like.
