    Hi. I'm a web developer based just outside of Oxford. I prefer backend development, and I have experience with PHP, but my favourite backend language is C#. I can also do frontend development with HTML5, CSS3 (but preferably Sass) and JS. I'm a big fan of MVC, modular programming, and doing it right the first time.
</p>
<p>
    I work for a great company called <a href="http://growcreate.co.uk" target="_blank">GrowCreate</a>. At GrowCreate I develop using an open source CMS called <a href="http://umbraco.com/why-umbraco" target="_blank">Umbraco</a>, which is built on top of ASP.NET.

<h3>Say that again, but without the jargon</h3>
<p>
    Basically, I can build websites. I care about quality, because quality code is more fun to work with.

    Then take a look at my <a href="portfolio">portfolio</a>. If you're techy and you want to see code, then take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/HarveyWilliams" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile - you can even see the source files for this website.

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>
    I'm a bit of a nerd, and I love pretty much anything open source. Whenever I'm working, and pretty much whenever there's a moment of silence, I like to listen to music. Anything with a guitar and an indie feel I'll like. You can find a couple of my playlists <a href="http://8tracks.com/harveyjwilliams" target="_blank">here</a>. I also love to travel, even if it means stepping out of my comfort zone.
