	Carewatch is a service that helps people continue to live a normal life in their own home. Carewatch provides care and the website allows users to find out more information about what Carewatch does.

	GrowCreate has a support contract with Carewatch that allows us to maintain the website and add features as they are needed. The site is built on an old implementation of Umbraco which has been repeatedly upgraded to later and later versions. Currently the site is on a recent build of Umbraco v6.

	Most of the pages are built using an older sort of code called XSLT. This is a slight difficultly to me as I am more used to building sites using HTML (or specifically CSHTML for ASP.NET).
