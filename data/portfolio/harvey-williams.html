<p>
	This site was one of my first experiments in creating a Node.JS based website. At first I was sceptical about using an ordinarily front end language for the back end since that language is so loosely typed, but I have had a great time using the technology. Since it's been built from the ground up with no large CMS backend, the site is extremely fast.
