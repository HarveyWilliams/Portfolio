<h2>What is Skyval?</h2>
<p>
	Skyval is a company that helps its clients understand investment opportunities using data driven analysis. They have a platform which can be accessed through the web or through their app which helps break down confusing data into simpler charts.

<h2>The project</h2>
<p>
	GrowCreate had previously built a website for Skyval, but after a year, they came back to GrowCreate for a rebuild with a new design as they considered their old website to be not match the brand image they were aiming for.
</p>
<p>
	Skyval was the first website which I collaborated on at GrowCreate. It was also my first experience using ASP.NET as a backend language, and Umbraco as the CMS. This project introduced many new concepts to me, such as how an MVC framework holds itself together.
</p>
<p>
	Further more, Umbraco is not the easiest CMS to get setup, there's limited resources when compared to something much more common like Wordpress, which means that I had to think on my feet a lot more, and really understand what it was that I was trying to do. All of this created a steep learning curve, but Skyval is a comparatively simple project to some of the other websites which have been built at GrowCreate.
