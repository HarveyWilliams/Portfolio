<h2>What is Artists Name Plates?</h2>
<p>
	Artists Name Plates is a small business that makes gold tablets with customized text which are pinned onto antique frames. The business had a need for a website to make it easier for customers to gather information including the prices for each plate.

	Before the website, the only way for customers to make orders was by either ordering through eBay, emailing the business directly. The problem with this was that customers would usually not know what should be printed onto their plates. One major part of the website is the order form which clearly outlines what information the client needs to provide in order to make a successful order.

<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>
	After just learning how to use PHP to make basic web applications, I was itching for a real project to take on. Along came Artists Name Plates which needed a web presence and an online order form. My brother, Fraser Williams, did the original design and coded up most of the static content. It was up to me to design and build the form which had to take in user input and correctly calculate the price of each order.

	For over a year this original implementation stood, but it was clear that updates needed to be made to the site as the company grew larger. I decided to do a complete rebuild of the website with Umbraco so that the clients could edit content and add pages as they see fit. Also, using ASP.NET, I knew I would be able to create a much more complex form more features (such as a postcode lookup) for a better user experience.
