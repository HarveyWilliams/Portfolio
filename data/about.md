Hi. I'm a web developer. I'm not currently really based anywhere but if it helps, **I'm from England**.

I prefer backend development and I'm experienced with **C#** and **NodeJS**. I can also do frontend development with **HTML5**, **CSS3** (but preferably **Sass**) and **JS**. I have experience with frontend frameworks/libraries such as **React** and **Angular**.

I have integrated some websites with **ElasticSearch**.

I'm a big fan of MVC, modular programming, and doing it right the first time.

## Say that again, but without the jargon

Basically, I can build websites. I care about quality, because good code is more fun to work with.

## Need to see more?

Take a look at some of the [projects](/projects) I have worked on. If you're techy and you want to see code, then look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/harvzor) profile - you can even see [the source for this website](https://github.com/Harvzor/Portfolio).

## Interests

I'm a bit of a nerd, and I love open source code. Whenever I'm working, and pretty much when there's a moment of silence, I like to listen to music - anything with a guitar and an indie feel I'll like. I've been attempting to learn German for a long time but it's still pretty basic.
