Hi. I'm a web developer living in <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Oxford/" target="_blank" title="View in Google Maps">Oxford</a>. I prefer backend development, and I have experience with PHP, NodeJs, but I'm most experienced with C#. I can also do frontend development with HTML5, CSS3 (but preferably Sass) and JS. I'm a big fan of MVC, modular programming, and doing it right the first time.

I work for a great company called <a href="https://growcreate.co.uk" target="_blank">GrowCreate</a>. Usually you can find me developing websites using an open source CMS called <a href="https://umbraco.com/" target="_blank">Umbraco</a>.

## Say that again, but without the jargon

Basically, I can build websites. I care about quality, because good code is more fun to work with.

## Need to see more?

Take a look at my <a href="portfolio">portfolio</a>. If you're techy and you want to see code, then look at my <a href="https://github.com/HarveyWilliams" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile - you can even see the source for this website.

## Interests

I'm a bit of a nerd, and I love open source code. Whenever I'm working, and pretty much when there's a moment of silence, I like to listen to music - anything with a guitar and an indie feel I'll like. You can find a couple of my playlists <a href="http://8tracks.com/harveyjwilliams" target="_blank">here</a>.
