These are mostly hobby projects which I've worked on in my spare time because I love coding. You can see the code to some of these projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Harvzor).

**I've also worked on a ton of websites professionally**, which aren't displayed here. If you're looking to hire me, you can ask me about these projects.
