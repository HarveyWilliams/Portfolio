## What is the purpose of this website?

I guess the primary reason this website is to show that **I exist**. It allows me to show off what I've done with the [projects](/projects) page or to post my thoughts and advice on topics with the [blog](/blog).

## Technology

This site was one of my first experiments in creating something with Node.js. At first I was sceptical about using an ordinarily front end language for the back end since that language is so loosely typed, but I have had a great time using the technology. Since it's been built from the ground up with no large CMS backend, the site runs very fast, and I can control every aspect of it.

## Changes

The website is always underwork. I'm hardly a designer so trying to get it to look good is always a struggle.

I always hated having my picture in the aside along with the rubbish background picture. Although this makes it look a bit less personal, it certainly looks more professional.

Also, the website always looked awful on 4k monitors before this update as the content would just stretch on forever.
