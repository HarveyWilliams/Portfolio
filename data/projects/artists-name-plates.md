## What was the purpose of the website?

Artists Name Plates is a simple website that showcases custom made name plates that are added to the frame of a painting. The website also allows users to order their bespoke made plates.

## Original website built in 2013

2013 was an important year for my family. My parents were just starting their new company, and I had just started getting into the world of programming websites using PHP (a big upgrade from using Dreamweaver).

These were particularly dark days, before I knew what a debugger was, or what the difference between Javascript and jQuery was.

I was young and ready to start my first real project. My [brother](http://www.fraserwilliams.com/), who was an aspiring graphic designer, had designed and built a simple static brochure website for Artists Name Plates. The business would take orders either through eBay or by email. I knew this process could be improved if they had an online order form. So I started working, with my new PHP skills, on building the form.

**The form was a complete hack job and a good reason why I never want to look at PHP again.** I made a lot of basic mistakes, but I also learnt a lot.

### What was wrong with the website?

Apart from the rubbish spaghetti code which ran the website, there were a number of glaring issues:

- the content and prices hard coded
- the order form was ugly
- the order form didn't really check user input
- the website wasn't mobile friendly

## Website rebuild in 2018

The old website landed me a job at [GrowCreate](https://growcreate.co.uk/) in 2014 which let me hone my web development skills. I learnt how to use C# with the .NET Framework, and how to build scalable websites using [Umbraco CMS](https://umbraco.com/).

Therefore, the new website was going to be built with these technologies.

After a multiple redesigns, and different technology switches (from Backbone, to Angular, back to simple jQuery), I finally released the finished website in 2018.

### What was fixed?

- the content, pages and prices can be edited in Umbraco CMS
- the order form was improved and made prettier
- user input is now properly checked on both client and server side
- the website is now mobile friendly
