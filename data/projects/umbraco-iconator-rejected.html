	Modern websites tend to have many icons thrown onto the page to convey quick and easily understandable information to a user. Icons are great because they are a very visual way to tell someone what something is without them needing to spend time scanning text. The icon may be just a phone icon next to a phone number, or perhaps a home icon to show that a button is a link back to the index page.
</p>
<p>
	It used to be that images such as JPGs and PNGs were used to display an icon to a user, but more recently, SVGs have become popular as they can be resized to any resolution and they will never get blurry.
</p>
<p>
	However, beyond SVGs are font files. Fonts can store a large number of vector graphics while keeping the file size low. A font file can be used a lot like an image sprite - and because all of the icons can be stored in a single file, it reduces the need for multiple HTTP calls, which helps make web pages load faster.
</p>
<p>
	CSS can then be updated to reference the different icons in the font file. Usually, a different class will be used for each icon, such as ".icon-phone" or ".icon-home". Some HTML can then be written which uses those classes:
</p>
<pre>
	<code>
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i class="icon-phone"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; +44 012345 678 789
&lt;/p&gt;
	</code>
</pre>
<h2>The CMS issue</h2>
<p>
	However, if your site uses a CMS and users of the CMS want to be able to choose what icon to place onto an area of the page, having icons only accessible through CSS classes can make things difficult. The user could write the name of the icon that they want to use, but this can be prone to human error - if they misspell the CSS class, or capitalise it wrong, then the class won't work, leaving your CMS user confused and probably annoyed.
</p>
<p>
	A best of both world solution would be allow CMS users to select an icon, but save the class as the value. This means the class can be used in the code, while the CMS user still gets to see what will really get put on the page. This is why I built Iconator.
